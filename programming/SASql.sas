/*
This is is an demonstration of both SAS and SAS's implementation of SQL. 

It is titled "SASql" because SAS's SQL is not identical to normal SQL syntax, but more of a hybrid between SAS syntax and SQL syntax; 
this differs from other programming languages where you call SQL through a function and pass through native SQL syntax.
